Terraform AWS InfrastructureThis repository contains a Terraform configuration to provision a robust and scalable infrastructure on AWS, including a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster, and an Amazon DocumentDB cluster.Table of ContentsIntroductionModules UsedVPC ModuleEKS ModuleDocumentDB ModulePrerequisitesUsageVariablesIntroductionThis Terraform setup automates the deployment of core AWS services. It's designed to provide a secure and isolated network environment (VPC), a managed Kubernetes service for container orchestration (EKS), and a NoSQL document database (DocumentDB) for your applications.Modules UsedThe configuration leverages local Terraform modules to logically separate and manage different infrastructure components:VPC Modulesource = "./modules/vpc"This module is responsible for setting up the networking infrastructure. It provisions:A new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a specified CIDR block.Public subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for public-facing resources.Private application subnets across multiple AZs for application instances.Private data subnets across multiple AZs for database instances, ensuring isolation.Internet Gateway, NAT Gateways, and Route Tables to enable connectivity.EKS Modulesource = "./modules/eks"This module deploys an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster. It configures:An EKS control plane with a specified Kubernetes version.An EKS Node Group, which consists of EC2 instances that serve as worker nodes for your Kubernetes cluster.It utilizes the private application subnets created by the vpc module to ensure that EKS worker nodes are in a private network segment.DocumentDB Modulesource = "./modules/documentdb"This module sets up an Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) cluster. It includes:A DocumentDB Subnet Group to associate the database instances with specific subnets.A DocumentDB Cluster with a unique identifier.It uses the private data subnets from the vpc module to ensure the DocumentDB instances are securely isolated within your VPC.PrerequisitesBefore you can run this Terraform configuration, ensure you have the following installed and configured:AWS CLI: Configured with appropriate credentials and default region.aws configure
Terraform: Version 0.13 or higher.brew install terraform # macOS
# Or follow official Terraform installation guide
An AWS Account: With sufficient permissions to create VPCs, EKS clusters, and DocumentDB clusters.UsageFollow these steps to deploy your AWS infrastructure using this Terraform configuration:Clone the Repository (if applicable):git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
Initialize Terraform: Navigate to the root directory of this configuration (where main.tf is located) and initialize Terraform. This command downloads the necessary providers and modules.terraform init
Review the Plan: Generate an execution plan to see what actions Terraform will perform. This is a crucial step to verify that the planned changes align with your expectations.terraform plan
Apply the Configuration: Apply the planned changes to provision the resources in your AWS account. You will be prompted to confirm the action by typing yes.terraform apply
Destroy Resources (Optional): If you need to tear down the entire infrastructure, you can use the destroy command. Be extremely cautious with this command as it will remove all provisioned resources.terraform destroy
VariablesThe main.tf file uses several input variables to parameterize the deployment. These variables can be defined in a terraform.tfvars file, passed via the command line (-var), or set as environment variables.Variable NameDescriptionExampleregionThe AWS region where the resources will be deployed.us-east-1aws_vpc_cidr_blockThe CIDR block for the main VPC.10.0.0.0/16private_app_subnet_az1_cidrCIDR block for the private application subnet in Availability Zone 1.10.0.1.0/24private_app_subnet_az2_cidrCIDR block for the private application subnet in Availability Zone 2.10.0.2.0/24private_data_subnet_az1_cidrCIDR block for the private data subnet in Availability Zone 1.10.0.3.0/24private_data_subnet_az2_cidrCIDR block for the private data subnet in Availability Zone 2.10.0.4.0/24public_subnet_az1_cidrCIDR block for the public subnet in Availability Zone 1.10.0.5.0/24public_subnet_az2_cidrCIDR block for the public subnet in Availability Zone 2.10.0.6.0/24project_nameA name used to tag resources, helping with identification and cost allocation.my-applicationeks_cluster_nameThe desired name for the EKS cluster.my-eks-clustereks_versionThe Kubernetes version for the EKS cluster.1.28node_group_nameThe name for the EKS Node Group.my-node-groupdocdb_subnet_group_nameThe name for the DocumentDB Subnet Group.my-docdb-subnet-groupdocdb_cluster_idendifierThe identifier for the DocumentDB cluster.my-docdb-cluster
